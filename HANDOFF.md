# Handoff

## Session: 2026-10-21 - Milestone 4 (Module Expansion: UpdatePractice.ahk)

### Modified
- **Step 4.2**:
  - Implemented `Lib/UpdatePractice.ahk`:
    - Multi-path network and local discovery via `SafeFileExist` (`W:\`, `X:\`, `P:\`, `S:\`, UNC shares, local Program Files).
    - Authentication flow using `TRLogin()` for initial staff sign-in and waiting for user database password entry (`WinWait("Practice CS -")`).
    - Handled startup bulletins and modals via `HandleBulletins()`.
    - Navigated CS Connect, triggered "Call Now", read Call Summary text, and deferred installation by clicking "No" on "Apply Updates" prompt to prevent disruptive firm-wide database locks.
    - Returned standardized `" - Updates available (Manual)"` or `" - No updates"`.
  - Registered `PracticeCS` in `Core/AppRegistry.ahk` (`Apps` array).
  - Updated `GetAppCategory(appName)` in `Core/AppRegistry.ahk` to sort interactive database-login apps (`Accounting CS` & `Practice CS`) into Category 1 at the beginning of the queue.
  - Added `#Include <UpdatePractice>` in `NMGIUpdates.ahk`.
  - Updated `PROJECT_SPEC.md` active modules list and directory layout.

- **Step 4.2b**:
  - Added `\\sql1` network paths (`\\sql1\WinCSI`, `\\sql1\WINCSI$`, `\\sql1\Creative Solutions`, and root share) for both `PracticeCS.exe` and `practice.exe` in `Lib/UpdatePractice.ahk`.

- **Step 4.2c**:
  - Identified production executable as `CreativeSolutions.Practice.exe`.
  - Prioritized `\\sql1\winCSI\Practice CS\CreativeSolutions.Practice.exe` and `T:\Practice CS\CreativeSolutions.Practice.exe` at the top of `potentialPaths` in `Lib/UpdatePractice.ahk`.
  - Added `CreativeSolutions.Practice.exe` across all mapped drive letters (`T:`, `W:`, `X:`, `P:`, `S:`), UNC shares (`\\sql1`, `\\wbsql1`, `\\tho1`, `\\agcfsapp1`), and local paths while retaining legacy binary fallbacks.

- **Step 4.2d**:
  - Fixed infinite wait in CS Connect: added explicit 3000ms timeouts to `WaitElement`, matching both "Call Now" and "Connect" with keyboard Enter fallback.
  - Fixed infinite wait reading Call Summary: added 3000ms timeout for Document, followed by Edit, Text, and native `WinGetText` fallbacks.
  - Implemented multi-tiered button dismissal (UIA -> ControlClick -> Keyboard Enter/Space -> WinClose) for both `Call Summary` and the underlying `Online Status` window, ensuring Practice CS is never blocked by modal dialogs.

- **Step 4.2e**:
  - Fixed false-positive update reporting: replaced individual element property reads with `callSumEl.DumpAll()` and `WinGetText("Call Summary")` combined text search, reliably catching `"No new updates are available"`.
  - Gated `" - Updates available (Manual)"` strictly on the vendor's `"Apply Updates"` confirmation dialog (which only pops up when updates were actually downloaded and pending application), defaulting to `" - No updates"` if absent.

### Tested
- Automated AHK v2 smoke test (`smoke.ps1`) passes cleanly (`PASS: script still running after 8 s (PID 32292)`).
- Validated category ordering logic: Category 1 items (`Accounting CS`, `Practice CS`) run first upfront, followed by automated TR apps (Category 2), QuickBooks (Category 3), Lacerte/Adobe (Category 4), and Browsers (Category 5).

### Unfinished Logic / Known Quirks Documented
- Live CS Connect call and "Apply Updates" dismissal requires validation on an operator workstation with Thomson Reuters Practice CS installed.
- Commented-out `#Include <UpdateFPS>` in `NMGIUpdates.ahk` remains in `archive/` awaiting future modernization.

### Next Step / Status
- Ready for operator verification of `Practice CS` check on test machine with `\\sql1` network share, or proceeding to modernize `UpdateFPS.ahk` (Step 4.3).
